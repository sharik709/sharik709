I‚Äôm a **self-taught software developer**, hacker at heart, and tech enthusiast based in **Thane, India**. My journey in tech started out of pure curiosity, driven by a passion for understanding **how things work**, breaking them down, and building them back up again (hopefully better!). From my early days of fiddling with computers, I knew this was more than just a career‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle. 

### Who Am I?
By profession, I‚Äôm a **full-stack developer** with a special love for **Laravel**, **PHP**, and recently, I‚Äôve been diving deep into the world of **Rust**. I‚Äôm always fascinated by the elegance of good code and the thrill of solving real-world problems with it. I‚Äôve worked on countless projects, from simple websites to full-blown systems, and I still feel like I‚Äôm only scratching the surface of what's possible.

But beyond my work, I‚Äôm a **father**, a **husband**, and someone who enjoys the chaos of juggling a busy family life while trying to stay on the cutting edge of technology.

---

### My Tech Journey üõ†Ô∏è
I didn‚Äôt follow the conventional path. With no formal degree in software engineering, I started by building things, failing, learning, and repeating the process‚Äî**failure has been my greatest teacher**. Over time, I‚Äôve developed expertise in:

- **Web Development** with Laravel and **full-stack applications**.
- **Homelab Enthusiast**: I run a full-blown homelab with **Proxmox**, **TrueNAS**, and **Docker**. It‚Äôs my playground for all things cloud, infrastructure, and self-hosted tools.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: My recent obsession is getting AI models to run efficiently on hardware I‚Äôve assembled from scratch. 
- **Blockchain Exploration**: I‚Äôm diving into decentralized technologies, experimenting with **ERC-20 tokens**, custom blockchains, and understanding the infrastructure of cryptocurrency.

I‚Äôm constantly tinkering, building, and learning‚Äîwhether it's creating a custom **Linux distribution** or figuring out how to optimize my server for **AI workloads**. If it‚Äôs tech-related, I‚Äôm probably either working on it or about to.

---

### What I‚Äôm Passionate About ‚ù§Ô∏è
I believe in the beauty of **open-source**. I‚Äôm always on the lookout for exciting self-hosted tools, from **Uptime Kuma** to **Web-Check**‚Äîanything that gives me more control over my digital world. My love for tech extends beyond work; it's about empowerment, learning, and building things that make a difference.

---

### My Current Tech Stack üîß
Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been using lately to create, experiment, and learn:

- **Languages**: PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Python
- **Frameworks**: Laravel, Vue.js, Electron
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: Docker, Proxmox, TrueNAS, Linux, Ansible
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **DevOps Tools**: Git, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Terraform
- **AI/ML Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Blockchain Tech**: Solidity, Ethereum, Web3.js

---

### My Homelab & Hardware Setup üñ•Ô∏è
I‚Äôm a firm believer that you don‚Äôt need to be running enterprise-level infrastructure to get serious about tech. In my homelab, I run everything from **media servers** to **AI experiments**. I love getting my hands dirty with the hardware, and here‚Äôs what powers my lab:

- **Dell R710 Gen 2 Server** with **Xeon X5675** processors and 288GB RAM.
- **Proxmox** for virtualization, hosting several **LXC containers** and **VMs**.
- **TrueNAS** for data storage and sharing over SMB.
- **MikroTik Hex S** for routing, **TP-Link AX73** for Wi-Fi.
- **Jackett, Transmission, Jellyfin** for media and torrent handling.

---

### My Learning & Growth üìö
I‚Äôm a lifelong learner. When I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm probably buried in a book or reading up on the latest in **AI** and **blockchain technologies**. I‚Äôve always believed that knowledge is the greatest investment, and I love exploring topics that challenge my thinking‚Äîwhether it's understanding **human behavior**, diving into **psychology**, or questioning **societal norms**.

I‚Äôm also a big believer in the philosophy of having a **‚ÄúSense of Enough‚Äù**‚Äîbalancing ambition with contentment, something I‚Äôve reflected on through my journey as a freelancer.

---

### Fun Facts About Me üé∏
- I‚Äôve got a **small library** of over 150 books, and I‚Äôm always adding more. 
- I play both the **piano** and **guitar**, though I‚Äôm definitely more of a learner than a master!
- I‚Äôm an **INFJ**, which means I‚Äôm all about deep thinking, problem-solving, and helping others.

---

### What I‚Äôm Currently Working On üî®
1. **Custom Linux Distro**: Building a personalized distro for my **Dell R710** to optimize it for AI workloads.
2. **WebSocket Project**: Developing a real-time communication app using **Laravel WebSockets**.
3. **Blockchain Exploration**: Learning the ins and outs of creating **ERC-20 tokens** and deploying them on Ethereum.
4. **AI Research**: Training machine learning models and improving my server setup for AI research.
